# Pull Request: Discord Integration Support

## 🎉 Overview

This PR adds **complete Discord support** to Kit, transforming it from a Slack-only bot into a **multi-platform AI assistant** that can run on Slack, Discord, or both simultaneously.

## 🚀 What's New

### Major Features Added
- ✅ **Full Discord Integration** - Complete Discord bot with real-time messaging
- ✅ **Multi-Platform Architecture** - Run on Slack, Discord, or both
- ✅ **Shared AI Intelligence** - Same Gemini/Claude AI across all platforms
