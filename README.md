### 1. Create a Slack App

1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click "Create New App" â†’ "From scratch"
3. Give your app a name and select your workspace
4. Go to "OAuth & Permissions" and add these Bot Token Scopes:
   - `app_mentions:read`
   - `chat:write`
   - `im:read`
   - `im:write`
5. Install the app to your workspace
6. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)

### 2. Enable Socket Mode

1. Go to "Socket Mode" in your app settings
2. Enable Socket Mode
3. Create an App-Level Token with `connections:write` scope
4. Copy the App-Level Token (starts with `xapp-`)

### 3. Configure Event Subscriptions

1. Go to "Event Subscriptions"
2. Enable Events
3. Subscribe to these bot events:
   - `app_mention`
   - `message.im`

### 4. Environment Setup

   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## AI Integration

The bot currently includes a simple echo response. To integrate with AI services:

1. **OpenAI Integration**: Add your OpenAI API key to `.env` and implement the OpenAI client
2. **Claude Integration**: Add your Anthropic API key to `.env` and implement the Anthropic client
3. **Custom AI**: Implement your own AI service in the `generateAIResponse` function

## Development

- The bot uses Socket Mode for real-time connections
- Messages are handled in `handleEventMessage`
- AI responses are generated in `generateAIResponse`
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env` file

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Ensure your app has the necessary OAuth scopes
3. Consider using a process manager like systemd or supervisor
4. Set up logging and monitoring
